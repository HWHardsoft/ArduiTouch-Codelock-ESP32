# ArduiTouch-Codelock-ESP32
Different people asked me for a very simple code example for our ArduiTouch ESP set with out too much additional functions. This is a very simple codelock / keypad example for ArduiTouch ESP with ESP8266 to demonstate the basic graphic and audio features of the ArduiTouch kit.
